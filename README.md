# PYTHON-SOCKET-MODULE
A socket is a software object that allows data to be sent and received between remote hosts (via a network) or between local processes, such as Inter-Process Communication (IPC). With the internet, sockets make communication between diverse and globally scattered machines much easier compared to other systems/methods.
